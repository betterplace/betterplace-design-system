# About the Design System

## Purpose

With the design system we mainly want to break down _things_ in order to have a modular system that enables us to

- **reuse** things (design and develop faster) and
- keep things **consistent** (improve UX and maintainability).

We also want to provide clear and comprehensive guides for designers, copy writers, developers and testers to facilitate better collaboration and communication.

## Structure

The design system is more than a ‚Äúcomponent inventory‚Äù. Our design system consists of the following parts:

- Guides: Guidelines, principles, and best practices for designers, copy writers, developers and testers
- Tokens: Variables that define the visual attributes of the design system
- Elements: Bare HTML elements with defined visual properties
- Components: Specific self-contained UI components
- üöß **TBD Will there be more? Hooks? Lib?**
