# About the Design System

## Goal

We want to break down things in order to have a modular system that enables us to

- **reuse** things (save time) and
- keep things **consistent** (improve UX and maintainability).

## Structure

A design system is more than a “component inventory”. Our design system consists of the following parts:

- Guides: 🚧 **TBD Add short description**
- Tokens: 🚧 **TBD Add short description**
- Elements: 🚧 **TBD Add short description**
- Components: 🚧 **TBD Add short description**
- 🚧 **TBD Will there be more? Hooks? Lib?**
