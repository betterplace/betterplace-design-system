# UX Design guide

## Design principles

- **Human Centered:** Specify context, be empathetic, test often, iterate
- **Accessible:** All our product should be able to be used by as many people as possible. More on that in accessibility.
- **Joyful:** Doing something good should feel good and be fun.
- **Responsive:** Our products should work on all devices. Layouts should adapt and support.

## Vision

Our Vision is to create seamless, beautiful and professional design. Accessible for everyone. We want our users to find quickly what they need, have fun while using it and engage highly through them with others to create impact for good.

## Mission

We want clarity, system and consistency in design. We want that once set design rules are used as strong guidelines and have leverage in discussions. Our design should be a facilitator for better communication and processes and not an obstacle in the way of innovation. The user / human should always be at the center of every decision.

## Values

- Empowering
- Honest
- Open

## UX Visions (2021)

### Donors

People always choose the right project to donate to as there is no wrong project on our platform. Due to the needed and helpful information they feel secure and donate in a quick and easy way to get the lasting feeling of having done something good.

### Recipients

Project mangers quickly find solutions for their fundraising needs and benefit from our expertise and experience with digital fundraising. Projects managers can strongly feel the impact of our large donor base and reach on their project.

### Activators

Fundraising event managers feel the positive impact of their community. They are celebrated because they mobilize a community that achieves more than its individual members by themselves.

## Logo

The new logo of betterplace consists of a word-image mark in combination with an emotional claim.

The figurative mark consists of a heart in the center of a pin. The word mark is set in a sans serif dynamic grotesque font in which all letters are individually connected.

## Typography

## Applicable for everyone working with text

- we always use unbreakable half spaces between numbers and signs
- we use the date format: day.month.year

## Colors

### Our colors are beautiful and accessible.

### Principles:

#### **Communication is key**

Although we value an aesthetically pleasing use of color, we place a higher value on clear communication. Color supports the purpose of the content, communicating things like hierarchy of information, interactive states, and the difference between distinct elements.

#### **Colors have meaning**

Colors have assigned roles, which hold a specific meaning based on how they function within the interface. Defined color roles make things easy to modify and customize later. They also extend the color system so it works across any touchpoint at Shopify.

#### **Colors follow accessibility guidelines**

The color system is designed within the HSLuv color space to generate themes that meet WCAG 2.1 compliant contrast ratios. This makes things easier to find, identify, and interact with. It also makes the whole experience more accessible for merchants who are color blind or who have low vision. However you should never convey information using color alone.

## Icons

### Illustrative Icons

These icons are rather mini illustrations. They are a bit decorative but still clear in their message. They should help to liven up status feedbacks.
**Example:** ðŸš§

### Functional Icons

The icons are there to make functions stand out quickly to the users. They are simple and should be unambiguous in their meaning.
**Example:** ðŸš§

## Images

Photos should always show positive motives in clear, bold colors. If possible they should be from actual projects and only from a stock photo archive if necessary.
