# Manual testing guide

ðŸš§ Add general testing guidelines

## Testing accessibility

- Test with a **pointing device** (e.g. a computer mouse) and **touch device** to ensure interactive elements work.
- Test responsiveness and touch usability on **mobile** devices.
- **Zoom** in and out (ctrl +/-) and change the font size in your browser settings to ensure content is accessible outside your standard view.
- Test with **only a keyboard** to ensure all content is accessible without using a pointing or touch device. ([Intro to keyboard testing](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/))
- Test with a **screen reader** (learn how below) to ensure all content is accessible and coherent when read aloud.
- If content changed / has been added: Read through the **content** to ensure everything is understandable.
- If design changed / is new: Emulate **color vision deficiencies** (learn how below) to ensure content is distinguishable.

### How to test with a screen reader

According to a [survey](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/) conducted by WebAIM, more than 90% of screen reader users reported using a screen reader on Windows. The most popular screen readers are

- JAWS (Windows, can run in free demo mode for 40 minutes at a time)
- NVDA (Windows, free) and
- VoiceOver (Mac, free).

#### Basics

- [Summary of screen reader testing on Android and iOS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/Mobile#summary_of_screen_reader_testing_on_android_and_ios)

#### How to test with JAWS (Windows)

JAWS works best with Chrome and Firefox. When testing, pair it with Chrome.

#### How to test with NVDA (Windows)

NVDA works best with (and should, therefore, be paired with) Firefox.

#### How to test with VoiceOver (Mac)

VoiceOver works best with (and should, therefore, be paired with) Safari.
