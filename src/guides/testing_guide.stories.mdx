ðŸš§ Add general testing guidelines

## Testing accessibility

- Test with a **pointing device** (e.g. a computer mouse) and **touch device** to ensure interactive elements work.
- **Zoom** in and out (ctrl +/-) and change the font size in your browser settings to ensure content is accessible outside your standard view.
- Test with **only a keyboard** to ensure all content is accessible without using a pointing or touch device. ([Intro to keyboard testing](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/))
- Test with a **screen reader** to ensure all content is accessible and coherent when read aloud. ([Intro to using a screen reader](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2021/09/29/browsing-with-a-desktop-screen-reader/))
- If content changed / has been added: Read through the **content** to ensure everything is understandable.
- If design changed / new: Emulate **color vision deficiencies** to ensure content is distinguishable.
- Test responsiveness and touch usability on **mobile** devices ([Intro to mobile accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/Mobile)).
