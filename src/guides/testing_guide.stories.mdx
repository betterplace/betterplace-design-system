# Manual testing guide

ðŸš§ Add general testing guidelines

## Testing accessibility

- Test with a **pointing device** (e.g. a computer mouse) and **touch device** to ensure interactive elements work.
- Test responsiveness and touch usability on **mobile** devices.
- **Zoom** in and out (ctrl +/-) and change the font size in your browser settings to ensure content is accessible outside your standard view.
- Test with **only a keyboard** (learn how below) to ensure all content is accessible without using a pointing or touch device.
- Test with **screen readers** (learn how below) to ensure all content is accessible and coherent when read aloud.
- If content changed / has been added: Read through the **content** to ensure everything is understandable.
- If design changed / is new: Emulate **color vision deficiencies** (learn how below) to ensure content is distinguishable.

### How to test with only a keyboard

- Browser keyboard navigation has to be enabled manually on MacOS: https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/macos-browser-keyboard-navigation/

### How to test with screen readers

#### Getting started

- [Browsing with a desktop screen reader](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2021/09/29/browsing-with-a-desktop-screen-reader/)
- [Browsing with a mobile screen reader](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2021/10/05/browsing-with-a-mobile-screen-reader/)
- [Introduction to screen reader usage](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/knowledge/screen-readers/)

#### Which browser and screen reader pairings to test

According to a [survey](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/) conducted by WebAIM, more than 90% of screen reader users reported using a desktop screen reader on Windows.

The most popular **desktop screen readers** are

- **JAWS** (Windows, can run in free demo mode for 40 minutes at a time)
- **NVDA** (Windows, free) and
- **VoiceOver** (MacOS, free).

The by far most popular **mobile screen readers** is **VoiceOver on iOS/iPadOS**.

Testing with screen readers work best when they are paired with the browsers they are the most compatible with.

- JAWS works best with Chrome and Firefox. When testing, it should be paired with Chrome.
- NVDA works best with and should be paired with Firefox.
- VoiceOver (MacOS and iOS/iPadOS) works best with and should be paired with Safari.

**At betterplace** we test with:

- NVDA (Windows)
- VoiceOver (iOS/iPadOS)

#### How to test with NVDA (Windows)

As NVDA only runs on Windows, but we use Macs at betterplace, we have to either set up a [virtual machine](https://dequeuniversity.com/mac/windows-screen-readers) or use a service similar to BrowserStack or [AssistivLabs](https://assistivlabs.com/pricing).
