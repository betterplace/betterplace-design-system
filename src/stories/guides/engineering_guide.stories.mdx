# Engineering guide

🚧 We have to discuss and improve this documentation.

### What is a thing?

Here, a “thing” is any*thing* that has _some meaning_ and needs _some consideration_ in the
context of a design system.

### Why call it “thing”?

The main reason for talking of “things” rather than any less general term referring to a wide range of entities
is that most common terms are already commonly used with specific meaning in the context of design systems,
especially by stylesheet management methodologies, such as BEM, OOCSS, or ITCSS. We cannot use “block”, “element”, “object”, nor
“component” because neither of these terms would describe all the entities we need to consider.

Not everything is complex enough to be a _“component”_, or atomic enough to be an _“element”_.
Some things are subatomic: _“tokens”_, and some are somewhere in between elements and components: _“objects”_.
That's why we call everything a _thing_.

## Classification guide

The above taxonomy of _element_, _object_, _component_ etc. might sound familiar: For high-level categorization
of things we borrow most of the wording from ITCSS as it is
a really elaborate (while natural) and well-proven approach.

### ITCSS

The [Inverted Triangle CSS](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528)
approach suggests organizing styles in layers which build upon each other and reach from completely general to
very specific scope. As [intended by its author](https://csswizardry.com/2018/11/itcss-and-skillshare/)
_Harry Roberts_ there is no official documentation. However, the general idea is pretty clear, as it's more or
less just a very thorough naming scheme for the most natural and sound way to organize (styling or any other)
rules: [From general to specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy#Containment_hierarchy).

We structure our code following our slightly adapted version of the ITCSS model:

1. Tokens (originally Settings)
2. Mixins (originally Tools)
3. Generic
4. Elements
5. Components (originally Objects and Components where distinguished)
6. Utilities

> _Mixins_, _Generic_ und _Utilities_ are mostly relevant for Frontend Engineers. _Tokens_, _Elements_ and _Components_ are the parts where UX Design and Frontend Engineering work most overlaps.
