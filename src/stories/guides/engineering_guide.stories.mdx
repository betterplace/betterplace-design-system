# Engineering guide

üöß We have to discuss and improve this documentation.

## Rationale

Although design systems mostly center on UI _components_ their complete scope ranges far beyond those.
Therefore, having just a ‚Äúcomponent inventory‚Äù is not enough for a design system.

### What is a thing?

Here, a ‚Äúthing‚Äù is any*thing* that has _some meaning_ and needs _some consideration_ in the
context of a design system.

### Why call it ‚Äúthing‚Äù?

The main reason for talking of ‚Äúthings‚Äù rather than any less general term referring to a wide range of entities
is that most common terms are already commonly used with specific meaning in the context of design systems,
especially by stylesheet management methodologies, such as BEM, OOCSS, or ITCSS. We cannot use ‚Äúblock‚Äù, ‚Äúelement‚Äù, ‚Äúobject‚Äù, nor
‚Äúcomponent‚Äù because neither of these terms would describe all the entities we need to consider.

Not everything is complex enough to be a _‚Äúcomponent‚Äù_, or atomic enough to be an _‚Äúelement‚Äù_.
Some things are subatomic: _‚Äútokens‚Äù_, and some are somewhere in between elements and components: _‚Äúobjects‚Äù_.
That‚Äôs why we call everything a _thing_.

## Classification guide

The above taxonomy of _element_, _object_, _component_ etc. might sound familiar: For high-level categorization
of things we borrow most of the wording from ITCSS as it is
a really elaborate (while natural) and well-proven approach.

### ITCSS

The [Inverted Triangle CSS](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528)
approach suggests organizing styles in layers which build upon each other and reach from completely general to
very specific scope. As [intended by its author](https://csswizardry.com/2018/11/itcss-and-skillshare/)
_Harry Roberts_ there is no official documentation. However, the general idea is pretty clear, as it‚Äôs more or
less just a very thorough naming scheme for the most natural and sound way to organize (styling or any other)
rules: [From general to specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy#Containment_hierarchy).

Here is, **in our own words**, and applied to our specific context, what each of these layers is about:

#### 1. Settings (We call it Tokens.)

In ITCSS _settings_ constitute the first layer.
It‚Äôs the most general layer and the one with the widest reach.
Everything defined here affects any other layer. Basically, it‚Äôs a set of constants specifying the values of
certain properties of the design. At _Salesforce_ they
[came up with calling these _‚Äúdesign tokens‚Äù_](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/living-design-system-3ab1f2280ef7#90cf)‚Äîwhich has become a well-established term. So, we adopt it, too.

- Platform-agnostically defined in a Style Dictionary, they are imported as
  [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
  (a. k. a. CSS variables) and, if needed, as preprocessor variables.
- For a reasonable implementation example of this layer see [Pollen](https://www.pollen.style/).

#### 2. Tools (We call it Mixins.)

- Globally used mix-ins and functions for CSS preprocessors.
- Using PostCSS, these will probably be implemented as @apply blocks.

#### 3. Generic

- Reset/normalize styles, e. g. box-sizing definition.
- Consider not to ‚Äúreset‚Äù styles that will be defined in `Elements`, anyways.
- One reasonable and modern normalizer is [normalize.css](https://csstools.github.io/normalize.css/).
- I also like my own topping to the former: [n‚Äôize.css](https://github.com/smnscp/n-ize.css)

#### 4. Elements

In ITCSS _elements_ constitute the fourth layer.
It‚Äôs reserved for bare HTML elements.

- For the classification of elements we follow
  [the HTML elements reference at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
  (which is also the knowledge base [recommended by the W3C](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform#HTML_Elements)).

#### 5. Objects (We call them Coponents. So we don't differentiate between Objects and Components.)

- Common design patterns as described by [OOCSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/)
- Normally represented by assigning a single classname.
- More specific than plain HTML elements, less complex than components (no application logic).
- E. g., layout objects, specific navigation menu patterns.
- (For the very common question:
  [Objects vs. Components](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/4rdf8x/itcss_objects_vs_components/))

#### 6. Components

- Specific self-contained UI pieces.
- Component styles build upon _1. Settings_ and _2. Tools_ to fit into the design system.
- Since the styles are specific to each component they can be kept next to the respective component code file.

#### 7. Utilities

- Utilities and helper classes.
- Overwrite anything else: use `!important`.
- Reserved for rare cases of one-offs that cannot be easily classified.
- Otherwise prone to support bad habits.
