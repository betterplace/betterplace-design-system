# Accessibility Guide

## About the Standard

The standard that we (and all others) refer to is WCAG 2
https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability.

These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.
Content must be POUR:

- **perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- **operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- **understandable:** Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
- **robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

There are three levels within this standard: A, AA and AAA. **The long-term goal should be to reach the AA level**. But one could start fixing all issues that prevent us from reaching A level.
There is a (german) testing and certification option for websites as well. But we didnâ€™t see reaching the certification as a goal for now.

## Accessibility in UX Design

- All text on background must reach at last AA readability (Check tool)
- No font size should be below 14px
- Touch-target size should always be at least 44x44px
- Good resources: Material Design Accessibility

## Accessibility in Code <a id="test" />

General remark: Use these rules thoughtfully. Always keep in mind that accessibility is not only about following rules, but about the best way to serve the needs of users.

### Markup

Use native HTML elements wherever it makes semantically sense. Most HTML elements convey a semantic meaning and provide additional functionality, that users can benefit from or even depend on.

#### Examples

- use a `button`, when an interaction triggers some action on the page, e.g. opening a modal, submitting a form, loading data, swiping a slider, etc.
- use an `a` tag with an `href` attribute for links, i.e. when the interaction navigates the user to a different page (or a different part of the page).
- use a `ul` or `ol`, whenever you want to group some items together in a list and want the user to know how many items the list contains. This does not only apply to "regular" text items, but can be anything, e.g. a gallery of images, a list of teasers, navigation items, etc.
- use headline tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) for headlines and use them in a logical order.

### Images

#### Alternative text

Make sure _every_ image has an `alt` attribute, either with

- a descriptive text (think of how you would describe the image to someone on the phone) or
- an empty string. This only applies to images that are purely decorative and don't contribute anything to the content.

If it's an image uploaded by the user, decide whether

- we can define a general rule, e.g. "avatar of _name of the user_". (Keep in mind that this is usually less valuable of an information. You should also be careful not to create redundancy.) Or
- we should give the user the possibility to enter their own alternative text.

More information about [writing good alt text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/).

#### Responsive Images

Make sure images are served only as big as necessary.

### Interactive components

- Make sure every form element has an associated `label`.
- Make sure every interactive element can be reached by using only the keyboard and the tab order is logical.
- Use an appropriate native element if possible (see [Markup](#Markup)).
- Use ARIA roles, properties and states if there is no such component provided by HTML out of the box.
- Use [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) for helper methods and the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) as a reference for common component patterns.

### Zooming and font size

- Don't use pixels values unless you explicitly want the value to stay consistent no matter the font size (which might be the case for borders and shadows for example).
- Use `rem` for most of the things and `em` when it makes sense (font sizes, line-height).

### Content structure and order

- Make sure every page has a title. There should only be one `h1` per page.
- Make sure heading levels are in a logical order.
- Use [landmarks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/landmark_role), such as `nav`, `main`, `section`, etc. It helps users navigate the page quicker.
- Don't move around items arbitrarily with CSS (be careful with `order`, `float` or `grid` for example). It can result in a [confusing experience for keyboard users](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/the-dark-side-of-the-grid-part-2/).

### Hiding content

Depending on the use case there are several [ways to hide content](https://kittygiraudel.com/2021/02/17/hiding-content-responsibly/). Think about whether the content should be

- visible
- machine readable (announced by a screen reader)

and based on that decide which approach is most appropriate.

#### Examples

- Visible but not machine readable (example: decorative icons)
- Invisible but machine readable (example: context for icon-only buttons)
- Invisible and not machine readable (example: offscreen content such as a closed modal window)
- Visible and machine readable (example: most stuff)
