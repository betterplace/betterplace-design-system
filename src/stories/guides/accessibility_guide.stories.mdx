### What is web accessibility?

- ‚ÄûWeb accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that **people with disabilities can use them**.‚Äù [[1]](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#what)
- Web accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities including **auditory**, **cognitive**, **neurological**, **physical**, **speech** and **visual**.

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

- The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) are an internationally agreed upon standard established to help developing accessible web content.
- The guidelines are organized by four main principles (POUR):
  - **Perceivable** ‚Äì Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
  - **Operable** ‚Äì User interface components and navigation must be operable.
  - **Understandable** ‚Äì Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
  - **Robust** ‚Äì Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
- Each guideline consists of one or more **success criteria**.
- To be compliant to a conformance level, you must meet all the success criteria of that level, plus all levels below it.
  - **A (Basic)** ‚Äì If this isn't met, assistive technology may not be able to read, understand, or fully operate the page or view.
  - **AA (Ideal)** ‚Äì Required for multiple government and public body websites.
  - **AAA (Specialized support)** ‚Äì This is typically reserved for parts of websites and web apps that serve a specialized audience.

### Best practices

General remark: Use these best practices thoughtfully. Always keep in mind that accessibility is not only about following rules, but about the best way to serve the needs of users.

<details>
<summary>For UX designers</summary>

<br />

#### Color

- All information-bearing elements must at least have a contrast of 4.5:1 (to background)
- Exceptions are UI controls (e.g. check in checkbox) color fills, text bigger than 18px (bold). They only need 3:1.
- Disabled and decorative elements don‚Äôt need to reach a contrast ratio: but even better is they do!
- Design color independently. That means, an interface needs to be understood in gray scale as well.

#### Interaction

Elements that can be interacted with should be clearly identifiable by unique signifiers that are only used for that type of interaction.

Rules of thumb:

- Text within a box is a button.
- Underlined, blue, underlined and blue text is a link.

Stick to one style for interactive elements throughout the platform to reduce interaction cost.

The **touch target size** (area of and around an element that triggers an action) needs to be at least **44 x 44px** (Google says 48 x 48px).
Make sure to have designed for all the states you need: **Default, hover, focus, pressed, disabled, loading/processing**, checked (toggled), visited.

Everything that can be swiped or dragged, needs also being able to be clicked/tabbed.

#### Content

- Each link that links to a unique url should have a unique and out of context understandable link text.
- All CTAs should include the main keyword and action verb within the first 1-3 words of the text/label (that‚Äôs all our brain focuses on and reads before making a decision).
- Every link is a promise: make it precise and transparent where it‚Äôll lead.

**Tip:** To avoid ‚Äúshow/read more links‚Äù link the headline of the content.

- Show hints and error messages right after the label (otherwise the user won‚Äôt know what to look out for before filling in the input).
  Never show important text below a CTA for the same reason.
- Make sure sighted and people with visual deficiency as well as cognitive disabilities (or tired and stressed people) can also skip through a page by using concise and comprehensive link/heading/button copy.
- Make sure all information-bearing icons, graphics and illustrations have an ALT text.

#### Markup

Use native HTML elements wherever it makes semantically sense. Most HTML elements convey a semantic meaning and provide additional functionality, that users can benefit from or even depend on.

##### Examples

- use a `button`, when an interaction triggers some action on the page, e.g. opening a modal, submitting a form, loading data, swiping a slider, etc.
- use an `a` tag with an `href` attribute for links, i.e. when the interaction navigates the user to a different page (or a different part of the page).
- use a `ul` or `ol`, whenever you want to group some items together in a list and want the user to know how many items the list contains. This does not only apply to "regular" text items, but can be anything, e.g. a gallery of images, a list of teasers, navigation items, etc.
- use headline tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) for headlines and use them in a logical order.

Complete [list of HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

#### Images

##### Alternative text

Make sure _every_ image has an `alt` attribute, either with

- a descriptive text (think of how you would describe the image to someone on the phone) or
- an empty string. This only applies to images that are purely decorative and don't contribute anything to the content.

If it's an image uploaded by the user, decide whether

- we can define a general rule, e.g. "avatar of _name of the user_". (Keep in mind that this is usually less valuable of an information. You should also be careful not to create redundancy.) Or
- we should give the user the possibility to enter their own alternative text.

More information about [writing good alt text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/).

##### Responsive Images

Make sure images are served only as big as necessary.

#### Interactive components

- Make sure every form element has an associated `label`.
- Make sure every interactive element can be reached by using only the keyboard and the tab order is logical.
- Use an appropriate native element if possible (see [Markup](#Markup)).
- Use ARIA roles, properties and states if there is no such component provided by HTML out of the box.
- Use [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) for helper methods and the [ARIA authoring practices guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) as a reference for common component patterns.

#### Zooming and font size

- Don't use pixels values unless you explicitly want the value to stay consistent no matter the font size (which might be the case for borders and shadows for example).
- Use `rem` for most of the things and `em` when it makes sense (font sizes, line-height).

#### Content structure and order

- Make sure every page has a title. There should only be one `h1` per page.
- Make sure heading levels are in a logical order.
- Use [landmarks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/landmark_role), such as `nav`, `main`, `section`, etc. It helps users navigate the page quicker.
- Don't move around items arbitrarily with CSS (be careful with `order`, `float` or `grid` for example). It can result in a [confusing experience for keyboard users](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/the-dark-side-of-the-grid-part-2/).

#### Hiding content

Depending on the use case there are several [ways to hide content](https://kittygiraudel.com/2021/02/17/hiding-content-responsibly/). Think about whether the content should be

- visible
- machine readable (announced by a screen reader)

and based on that decide which approach is most appropriate.

##### Examples

- Visible but not machine readable (example: decorative icons)
- Invisible but machine readable (example: context for icon-only buttons)
- Invisible and not machine readable (example: offscreen content such as a closed modal window)
- Visible and machine readable (example: most stuff)

## <a name="workflow"></a>Accessibility workflow

Accessibility (a11y) is incorporated into different steps of our workflow.

<img src="a11y_workflow.png" alt="Workflow sketch" width="50%" />

### 1. Discovery

- üöß Use a11y metrics (score?, number of critical issues?)

_In a later expansion stage_

- Interview people with disabilities to get a better understanding of their problems and needs.

### 2. Design

- Use [checklist](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/) (filtered by job roles _Visual Design_, _Content Design_ and _UX Design_) to make sure the design is accessible.
- üöß Make annotations to pass on a11y considerations to engineers.

_In a later expansion stage_

- Use design system to reuse accessible styles and components.

### 3. Refinement

- Use [checklist](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/) to make sure the planned implementation considers a11y.
- üöß Define a11yAC‚Äôs

### 4. Implementation

#### 4.1 Development & Automated testing

- Use [linter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) and [logging to the browser's console](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/react) to catch and fix a11y issues early.
- Read a11yAC‚Äôs (and eventually have a look at the [checklist](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/) again) to know what to code and how to test.
- Follow coding standards to avoid minor recurring a11y problems.

_In a later expansion stage_

- Use design system to reuse accessible styles and components.
- Add automated tests considering keyboard and screen reader usage

#### 4.2 Manual testing

- Read a11yAC‚Äôs to know what to test and how.
- Follow [manual testing guidelines](?path=/story/guides-testing-guide--page)

### 5. Measurement

- üöß Use a11y metrics (score?, number of critical issues?)

_In a later expansion stage_

- Perform UX Tests or other UX research methods with people with disabilities.

### Training

- Provide [a11y knowledge](#knowledge)
- üöß Share (basic) a11y knowledge in initial meetings / workshops

_In a later expansion stage_

- Regularly share a11y knowledge / discuss a11y topics in different meetings (Tech Talk, Sprint Review, ‚Ä¶)

### Documentation

- Keep documentation up to date

_In a later expansion stage_

- Build accessible design system.
- Derive a11yAC templates from a11yAC‚Äôs.
