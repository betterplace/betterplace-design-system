# Testing Accessibility

- [Quick accessibility tests anyone can do](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2022/01/18/quick-accessibility-tests-anyone-can-do/).
- If you write **code**, install [axe Linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=deque-systems.vscode-axe-linter).
- Use the **keyboard** to test tab behavior, focus visibility and order ([Intro to keyboard testing](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/)).
- Use a **screen reader** at least when testing complex components ([Intro to using a screen reader](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2021/09/29/browsing-with-a-desktop-screen-reader/)).
- **Zoom** in and out (ctrl +/-) and change the font size in your browser settings.
- Test responsiveness and touch usability on **mobile** devices ([Intro to mobile accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/Mobile)).
- Check the Accessibility tab in Storybook.
