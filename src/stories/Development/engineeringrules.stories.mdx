# Engineering rules (!!!WIP!!!)

#### How do we write our custom components?

- We use CSS Modules.
- We do not use Sass/SCSS for the Design System
  - because we donâ€™t need it for variables and nesting anymore. PostCSS allows us to do nesting.
  - because it will reduce bundle sizes.
  - because we want to have so many dependencies.
- We don't use a CSS Framework, we build our own

### CSS class splitting

CSS classes must always be written in one piece, as well in Slim as in JS.

- bad: `label-${success ? 'success' : 'error'}`
- good: `success ? 'label-success' : 'label-error'`
- bad: [https://css-tricks.com/the-sass-ampersand/#article-header-id-10](https://css-tricks.com/the-sass-ampersand/#article-header-id-10)

This helps to find all occurrences of classes while developing and, more importantly, [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) can detect used classes and purge the correct classes.
