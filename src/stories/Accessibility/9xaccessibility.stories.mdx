# Accessibility

## About the Standard

The standard that we (and all others) refer to is WCAG 2
https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability.

These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.
Content must be POUR:

- **perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- **operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- **understandable:** Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
- **robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

There are three levels within this standard: A, AA and AAA. **The long-term goal should be to reach the AA level**. But one could start fixing all issues that prevent us from reaching A level.
There is a (german) testing and certification option for websites as well. But we didnâ€™t see reaching the certification as a goal for now.

## A11y in Design

- All text on background must reach at last AA readability (Check tool)
- No font size should be below 14px
- Touch-target size should always be at least 44x44px
- Good resources: Material Design Accessibility

## A11y in Code

### Markup

Use native HTML elements wherever it makes semantically sense. Most HTML elements convey a semantic meaning and provide additional functionality, that users can benefit from or even depend on.

#### Examples:

- use a `button`, when an interaction triggers some action on the page, e.g. opening a modal, submitting a form, loading data, swiping a slider, etc.
- use an `a` tag with an `href` attribute for links, i.e. when the interaction navigates the user to a different page (or a different part of the page).
- use a `ul` or `ol`, whenever you want to group some items together in a list and want the user to know how many items the list contains. This does not only apply to "regular" text items, but can be anything, e.g. a gallery of images, a list of teasers, navigation items, etc.
- use headline tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) for headlines and use them in a logical order.

### Images

Make sure _every_ image has an `alt` attribute, either with

- a descriptive text (think of how you would describe the image to someone on the phone) or
- an empty string. This only applies to images that are purely decorative and don't contribute anything to the content.

If it's an image uploaded by the user, decide whether

- we can define a general rule, e.g. "avatar of _name of the user_". (Keep in mind that this is usually less valuable of an information. You should also be careful not to create redundancy.) Or
- we should give the user the possibility to enter their own alternative text.
