# Accessibility

## About the Standard

The standard that we (and all others) refer to is WCAG 2
https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability.

These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.
Content must be POUR:

- **perceivable:** Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- **operable:** User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- **understandable:** Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
- **robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

There are three levels within this standard: A, AA and AAA. **The long-term goal should be to reach the AA level**. But one could start fixing all issues that prevent us from reaching A level.
There is a (german) testing and certification option for websites as well. But we didnâ€™t see reaching the certification as a goal for now.
