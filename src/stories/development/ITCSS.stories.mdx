# ITCSS

The Inverted Triangle CSS approach suggests organizing styles in layers which build upon each other and reach from completely general to very specific scope.

This is, **in our own words**, what each of these layers is about:

1. Settings
  * A set of variables, called design tokens.
  * Initially set as preprocessor variables (if a preprocessor is used) and provided as CSS custom properties (a. k. a CSS variables).
  * E. g., fonts, colors, sizing, spacing, decoration, …
  * For a reasonable implementation example of this layer see [Pollen](https://www.pollen.style/).

2. Tools
  * Globally used mix-ins and functions for CSS preprocessors.
  * Using PostCSS, these will probably be implemented as @apply blocks.

3. Generic
  * Reset/normalize styles, e. g. box-sizing definition.
  * Consider not to “reset” styles that will be defined in `Elements`, anyways.
  * One reasonable and modern normalizer is [normalize.css](https://csstools.github.io/normalize.css/).
  * I also like my own topping to the former: [n’ize.css](https://github.com/smnscp/n-ize.css)

4. Elements
  * Styling for bare HTML elements.
  * Ideally, follow MDN’s [HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to organize this layer.

5. Objects
  * Common design patterns as described by [OOCSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/)
  * Normally represented by assigning a single classname.
  * More specific than plain HTML elements, less complex than components (no application logic).
  * E. g., layout objects, specific navigation menu patterns.
  * (For the very common question: [Objects vs. Components](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/4rdf8x/itcss_objects_vs_components/))

6. Components
  * Specific self-contained UI pieces.
  * Component styles build upon _1. Settings_ and _2. Tools_ to fit into the design system.
  * Since the styles are specific to each component they can be kept next to the respective component code file.

7. Utilities
  * Utilities and helper classes.
  * Overwrite anything else: use `!important`.
  * Reserved for rare cases of one-offs that cannot be easily classified.
  * Otherwise prone to support bad habits.
