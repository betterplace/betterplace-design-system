# Settings

In [ITCSS](?path=/story/development-foundations-itcss--page) _settings_ constitute the first layer.
It’s the most general layer and the one with the widest reach.
Everything defined here affects any other layer. Basically, it’s a set of constants specifying the values of
certain properties of the design. At _Salesforce_ they
[came up with calling these _“design tokens”_](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/living-design-system-3ab1f2280ef7#90cf)—which has become a well-established term. So, we adopt it, too.

## Naming Conventions

_Style Dictionary_ suggests using the [Category / Type / Item (CTI)](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/tokens?id=category-type-item) systematics.
