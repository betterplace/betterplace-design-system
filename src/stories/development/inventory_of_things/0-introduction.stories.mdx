# Inventory of Things

This is our inventory of _things_. It aims to list every_thing_ design system.

## What is a thing?

Here, a “thing” is any_thing_ that has _some meaning_ and needs _some consideration_ in the
context of a design system.

## Why call it “thing”?

This idea behind it is that not everything is complex enough to be a _“component”_,
or atomic enough to be an _“element”_. Some things are subatomic: _“tokens”_, and some are somewhere in between
elements and components: _“objects”_. (If you find these classifications familiar you probably have heard of
[ITCSS](?path=/story/development-foundations-itcss--page).
Yes, we borrow its wording due to its elaborateness.)

Therefore, having just a “component inventory” is not enough for a design system.
