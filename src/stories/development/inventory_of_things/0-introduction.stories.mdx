# Inventory of Things

This is our inventory of _things_. It aims to list every*thing* design system.

## Rationale

Although design systems mostly center on UI _components_ their complete scope ranges far beyond those.
Therefore, having just a “component inventory” is not enough for a design system.

### What is a thing?

Here, a “thing” is any*thing* that has _some meaning_ and needs _some consideration_ in the
context of a design system.

### Why call it “thing”?

The main reason for talking of “things” rather than any less general term referring to a wide range of entities
is that most common terms are already commonly used with specific meaning in the context of design systems,
especially by stylesheet management methodologies, such as BEM, OOCSS, or
[ITCSS](?path=/story/development-foundations-itcss--page). We cannot use “block”, “element”, “object”, nor
“component” because neither of these terms would describe all the entities we need to consider.

Not everything is complex enough to be a _“component”_, or atomic enough to be an _“element”_.
Some things are subatomic: _“tokens”_, and some are somewhere in between elements and components: _“objects”_.
That’s why we call everything a _thing_.

## Classification Guidelines

How do we classify things?

### High Level: ITCSS

The above taxonomy of _element_, _object_, _component_ etc. might sound familiar: For high-level categorization
of things we borrow most of the wording from [ITCSS](?path=/story/development-foundations-itcss--page) as it is
a really elaborate (while natural) and well-proven approach.

### Elements: Adhere to Standards

For the classification of elements we follow
[the HTML elements reference at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
(which is also the knowledge base [recommended by the W3C](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Open_Web_Platform#HTML_Elements)).
