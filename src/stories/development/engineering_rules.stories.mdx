# Engineering rules

üöß This is where we note down our agreements and rules as a developers team. Sor far, this is
rather a notepad. And its content is very much subject to change.

## Foundation

### CSS Framework

**We don‚Äôt rely on any existing CSS framework, we build our own.** After having worked with
and evaluated a couple of well-established CSS/UI frameworks (like Bootstrap, Foundation,
Tailwind, Bulma, Semantic, Chakra) we have learned and decided that our best bet is to build
our design system, and accordingly, our CSS system completely from scratch.

Our main reasons for this decision:

1. We won‚Äôt depend on framework maintainers and their decisions.
2. We will be flexible enough to meet any specific need of a large platform like ours.
3. **Because we can. And we ‚ù§Ô∏è CSS.** We are confident enough to write our stylesheets on our own.
  CSS is _not_ some obscure, secret science that needs to be handled somewhere under the hood
  of a 3rd-party framework. It‚Äôs a great technology that we‚Äôve grown up with over the last
  two decades. It‚Äôs a language we love.

### CSS methodologies

Not using a 3rd-party framework does not mean completely re-inventing the wheel. We are eager to
learn what the community knows and to build upon great ideas that others brought up.

## Tooling

### CSS preprocessor
- We use [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/).
- We do no longer need any other (traditional) preprocessor like Sass or LESS, because:
  - PostCSS allows for the same things we used to achieve with Sass/LESS:
    - variables,
    - nesting,
    - mix-ins, functions ‚Ä¶
  - Relying only on PostCSS spares us some dependencies.
  - It will reduce bundle sizes (?)

### CSS-in-JS
- For component-specific styles we employ CSS-in-JS, namely [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

## CSS coding conventions

### CSS class splitting (debatable!)

CSS classes must always be written in one piece, as well in Slim as in JS.

- bad: `label-${success ? 'success' : 'error'}`
- good: `success ? 'label-success' : 'label-error'`
- bad: [https://css-tricks.com/the-sass-ampersand/#article-header-id-10](https://css-tricks.com/the-sass-ampersand/#article-header-id-10)

This helps to find all occurrences of classes while developing and, more importantly, [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) can detect used classes and purge the correct classes.
