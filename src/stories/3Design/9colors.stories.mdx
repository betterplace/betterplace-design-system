# Colors

## Our colors are beautiful and accessible.

## Principles:

### **Communication is key**

Although we value an aesthetically pleasing use of color, we place a higher value on clear communication. Color supports the purpose of the content, communicating things like hierarchy of information, interactive states, and the difference between distinct elements.

### **Colors have meaning**

Colors have assigned roles, which hold a specific meaning based on how they function within the interface. Defined color roles make things easy to modify and customize later. They also extend the color system so it works across any touchpoint at Shopify.

### **Colors follow accessibility guidelines**

The color system is designed within the HSLuv color space to generate themes that meet WCAG 2.1 compliant contrast ratios. This makes things easier to find, identify, and interact with. It also makes the whole experience more accessible for merchants who are color blind or who have low vision. However you should never convey information using color alone.
